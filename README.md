# Tariff Calculator

This is the repo for the tariff calculator that I have hosted on my website at:

[Tariff Calculator Page](https://dilangilluly.us/projects/tariff-calculator/)

It uses a pretty-much stock React + Vite configuration so you can use their instructions on this application to run it in a dev environment or build it yourself.

## Dependencies

You will need NPM or Yarn capable of running or building Vite apps. For this readme I will be using NPM commands.

## Clone

`git clone https://github.com/dbob16/2025-tariff-calc.git`

All other commands will be run in the folder it's cloned into:

`cd 2025-tariff-calc`

## Download project dependencies

You can download project dependencies for this project using the following:

`npm install`

## Run in dev mode

If you wish to modify it and want to see your updates in real time, run the following:

`npm run dev`

Then Ctrl + Click the Local link to go to it, or just navigate to it in a web browser if your console doesn't support Ctrl + clicking links.

Your updates should show up in real time in your web browser.

## Build for developement

To build for development, you can use the following command:

`npm run build`

Then upload the contents of the dist folder to your server/webhost or include it into your own website.

You can iframe it like I did on my website by including the path to the index.html file it created in the src attribute of the iframe. You may have to play around with CSS styling to get it to display the way you want.
